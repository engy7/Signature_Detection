## Introduction
As digitization continues to advance, the demand for automated, accurate image processing has grown. This project focuses on signature detectionâ€”a task involving the identification and extraction of handwritten signatures from images or scanned documents. Signature detection plays an essential role in document digitization, especially for archival materials and authentication processes. By improving methods for signature detection, we aim to advance broader image processing techniques, which can enhance object detection, segmentation, and feature extraction.

## Research Problem and Objectives
The project aims to develop a robust system to automatically detect handwritten signatures in documents containing machine-printed and handwritten texts. This project will:
1. Apply traditional image processing techniques like contour detection, connected components, and feature extraction.
2. Evaluate deep learning models such as CNNs and object detection models like YOLO.
3. Benchmark classical and modern techniques using the Tobacco 800 dataset.

Ultimately, this project aims to advance automated signature verification and contribute to secure document handling in fields like banking and legal services.

## Literature Review
Traditional image processing algorithms (e.g., edge detection, morphological operations) have long been used in signature detection due to their simplicity. With the advent of machine learning, classifiers like SVMs and k-NN improved detection through feature-based learning, though often limited by feature quality and parameter tuning.

Deep learning further transformed signature detection, with models like CNNs, R-CNN, YOLO, and Faster R-CNN now common in document analysis. These models excel at detecting complex patterns and distinguishing materials, including signatures, from dense document backgrounds.

## Methodology
### Classical Image Processing Techniques
1. **Morphological Operations:** Enhance signature detection and reduce noise in binary images.
2. **Edge Detection:** Use Sobel, Canny, and Prewitt methods for identifying edges.
3. **Thresholding:** Apply methods like global and adaptive thresholding.
4. **Contour Detection:** Trace boundaries of signatures for shape extraction.
5. **Connected Components Analysis (CCA):** Label and separate connected pixel groups.

### Machine Learning and Feature-Based Approaches
1. **Feature Extraction:** Use Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).
2. **Classification Models:** Apply SVMs for signature classification.

### Deep Learning Approaches
1. **Object Detection Models:** YOLO and Faster R-CNN.
2. **YOLO:** Speed-oriented grid-based detection.
3. **Faster R-CNN:** Accuracy-focused using region proposal networks (RPN).

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
The Tobacco 800 dataset, consisting of 1290 scanned document images, is used for evaluation. Preprocessing steps include:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Filter low-quality images and apply noise reduction.
2. **Data Augmentation:** Apply transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping).
3. **Feature Selection:** Extract contour and stroke features for classical methods, while CNNs in deep learning approaches learn features during training.

Data is split into training, validation, and testing sets (80-10-10) for effective model training and evaluation.
